### SCOWL / Hunspell en_US wordlist (spell-check dictionary)
* The compressed word list at `src/Majorsilence.Forms/SpellCheck/en_US.words.gz` is a pre-expanded
  (all Hunspell PFX/SFX affix rules applied), deflate-compressed, sorted flat list of valid en_US
  word forms, derived from the official Hunspell `en_US` dictionary published at
  https://github.com/kevina/wordlist (wordlist.aspell.net / SCOWL), version 2020.12.07.
* Only the expanded word list is distributed; the original `.dic`/`.aff` source files are not
  included in this repository.
* SCOWL's permission notice explicitly covers "the output created from the scripts" (i.e., the
  expanded word list embedded here), and permits use, copying, modification, distribution, and
  sale provided the copyright and permission notice are preserved.

The collective work is Copyright 2000-2018 by Kevin Atkinson as well as any of the copyrights
mentioned below:

  Copyright 2000-2018 by Kevin Atkinson

  Permission to use, copy, modify, distribute and sell these word
  lists, the associated scripts, the output created from the scripts,

  supporting documentation. Kevin Atkinson makes no representations
  about the suitability of this array for any purpose. It is provided

The en_US Hunspell affix file (`en_US.aff`) is a heavily modified version of the original
`english.aff` file released as part of Geoff Kuenning's Ispell, and is covered by his BSD
license (part of SCOWL is also based on Ispell, so the Ispell copyright is included with the
SCOWL copyright):
